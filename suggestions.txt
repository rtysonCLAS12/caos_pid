---- DataList ----

Be able to select subset of variables from datalist, and remove subset of variables from datalist.
This would useful to have eg P, theta, phi in datalist, split and shuffle it
then remove p, theta, phi from training but have the data separately in right order to bin predictions in.

Be able to stack datalists, like this i can read several files, get a datalist from them, then stack them together

---- Training ----

Be able to plot loss vs epoch

Be able to add stopping criteria to training (eg if loss doesn't decrease by more than 10^-5)

In regression training, have other variable than accuracy printed to terminal.
MSE would make more sense.

Be able to change loss function.

Be able to output/plot test loss and accuracy during training to check for overfitting.
